Data Scientist,Pivotal Software,DC,Washington,112093,149318,"LOCATION: Remote (home based) with some travel to New York, Washington DC, Boston.

About Us VIDEO

Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.

You

As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.

The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""

Us

The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.

Your Day

While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:


Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.

Required Skills / Experiences

Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.

Desired Skills / Experiences

2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.

Data Scientist / Statistician,Ledger Investing,DC,Washington,-1,-1,"About Us:

Ledger Investing is a startup looking to transform insurance capital markets. Insurance securitization is already a $100 billion market, and the Ledger marketplace is designed to scale this to a $1+ trillion market. We are venture-backed and were part of the Winter 2017 class at Y Combinator.

We are an online marketplace that connects risk to capital. Risk originators, like insurers and brokers, get capital more cheaply than from traditional sources. Capital providers, like pension plans and other institutional investors, get access to an asset class that is completely uncorrelated with stocks and bonds -- consider how valuable that is in the current market! Ultimately, policyholders ultimately benefit from a more competitive insurance market.

About the Position:

Data scientists at Ledger are critical to the success of the company. Their primary role is to develop impartial estimates of risk/return profiles for insurance-linked securities, which can include the following challenges:

Blending portfolio-specific and industry-wide data to optimize the bias-variance tradeoff.

Empirically estimating underwriting team skill based on historical performance.

Building stochastic estimates of asset cash flows based on loss ratio forecasts and loss development patterns.

Dynamically updating asset valuations in real-time based on current policy and claims data.

Forecasting the ultimate disposition of insurance claims that are still open.

Accounting for material shifts in the composition of a portfolio over time.

If these problems sound fun and interesting, we'd love to have you on our team. We offer competitive compensation, including company stock options. Our headquarters are in Washington, DC, but this position can be full-time remote.

About You:

Successful candidates will have all of the following attributes:

Extensive knowledge of statistics, machine learning, and data science; MS or PhD in statistics or a related field preferred.

Familiarity with hierarchical modeling, time-series/state-space methods, and/or distribution fitting.

Demonstrated track record of applying and adapting statistical methods to solve complex real-world problems.

Extensive experience with R, Python, Julia or other open-source languages with strong numerical computing ecosystems. Ability to produce analyses that are reproducible and easy to understand/modify.

Ability to integrate data sources from a wide variety of sources (CSV, XLSX, databases, flat files, JSON, etc) and perform checks for integrity, consistency, and accuracy against known sources of truth.

Ability to work independently and communicate ideas effectively.

The following attributes will help candidates stand out from the crowd:

Working knowledge of property & casualty insurance, particularly from an actuarial and/or underwriting perspective.

Familiarity with Bayesian modeling via Stan.

Familiarity with version control, especially Git/GitHub.

Supply Chain Data Scientist (GS 13 Equivalent),"Credence Management Solutions, LLC",DC,Washington,67991,98323,"The U.S. President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI) is the US Government’s (USG) flagship global malaria initiative led by USAID and implemented together with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Initiative is results-based, focused, and exhibits a high level of financial and programmatic accountability. In 2015, PMI launched the next six-year strategy, setting forth a new bold vision, and an ambitious goal with specific objectives. The PMI Strategy for 2015-2020 takes into account the progress over the past decade and the new challenges that have arisen, and reflects the U.S. Government’s commitment to work with PMI-supported countries and partners to further reduce malaria deaths and substantially decrease malaria morbidity working towards the long term vision of a world free of malaria. The Bureau for Global Health (GH) serves as the Agency’s primary source of intellectual capital, technical leadership, and donor coordination for the health sector. GH is vested with the responsibility for advancing field-relevant, state-of-the-art research and the transfer of new technologies and approaches to field programs and in technically and programmatically supporting USAID Mission health program implementation in the field. The Office of Infectious Disease (ID) is one of GH’s eight offices. The Malaria Division is one of four divisions of the ID Office. Leadership, management, and oversight of PMI are carried out from the Malaria Division under the leadership of the US Global Malaria Coordinator as are management of USAID’s malaria research investments (most notably vaccine, drug, and insecticide research programs) and USAID’s global partner engagement including WHO and RBM Partnership to End Malaria.  To succeed in eliminating malaria, countries and their partners need to deploy the right resources at the right place and at the right time. By getting better, more accurate insights from existing data and accelerating the data-to-action cycle, countries and their partners can better respond to changes in on-the-ground conditions. That is why, in 2018, PMI began a major transformation towards greater use of data to inform decisions on resource allocation. As part of this new effort, PMI launched a new quarterly reporting process to ensure operational decision-making is based on timely and granular malaria data. In addition, at the headquarters level, PMI is developing a web-based data platform (“PMI Data Lake”) with analytics tools that will facilitate the triangulation and use of relevant datasets, including visualizations of epidemiological, supply chain, entomological, demographic, programmatic, and financial data. In addition to the quarterly reporting data, the PMI Data Lake will house other supply chain data including PMI order and shipment data and procurement planning and monitoring report data. In 2019, PMI entered a data sharing agreement with The Global Fund (GF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) that included supply chain data. This agreement provides the foundation to bring our various supply chain data together to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of our supply chain program. Key responsibilities include: providing guidance, monitoring, and technical support related to SC data needs to USAID at headquarters, and in the field with USAID Missions, PMI country teams, technical counterparts, implementing partners, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies. S/he will exercise independent judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines. The Data Scientist will receive day to day guidance from the Malaria Division Supply Chain Branch Chief. Job RequirementsThe Data Scientist is a key member of the Malaria Division’s SC Branch team. The Data Scientist will provide technical and programmatic expertise to PMI’s SC efforts to support PMI’s increased focus on enhancing data-driven decision-making internally and externally within focus countries. The Data Scientist will provide technical and programmatic guidance and support to strengthen and guide SC data collection, reporting and integration and implementation of data management platforms across PMI focus countries. The Data Scientist will support the work of PMI staff at USAID headquarters and in PMI countries. The Data Scientist will work in collaboration with global malaria stakeholders and technical partners, Ministries of Health, and USAID cooperating agencies to provide technical leadership with a focus on SC data and integration of data systems, strategic information management and data visualization. S/he will exercise professional judgment in planning and carrying out tasks, in serving USG priorities at critical technical and policy forums, in resolving problems and conflicts, and in taking steps necessary to meet deadlines.Technical AssistanceServe as a technical and programmatic resource for PMI’s supply chain team, particularly focused on data related topics.Organize, compile, query and analyze programmatic and technical data related to supply chain (e.g., inventory levels throughout the supply chain, consumption/demand, supply plans, orders and shipments, etc.) from disparate sources and in different formats to improve PMI’s ability to use data to drive supply chain-related decisions, and organize/analyze/present data for use in briefings, publications, and reports.Carry out quantitative analyses and triangulation of data from a variety of sources (e.g. financial, programmatic, epidemiological, entomological, supply chain, demographic) to unearth implementation obstacles and opportunities. Create data visualizations to better represent these analyses for a variety of stakeholders.

Pursuant to the decision by the North Atlantic Council to implement the NATO Command Structure Adaptation, ACT has developed a Strategic Alternatives Branch (SALT). The Branch provides the Commander with alternative ideas derived through the extensive use of data science and analytics that exist outside NATO’s conventional processes in the service of Warfare Development.

Background

SALT operates under the direction of the Deputy Chief of Staff (DCOS) for Strategic Plans & Policy (SPP). It studies complex challenges relevant to the security domain and in areas beyond NATO’s traditional geographic and functional expertise. The Branch uses advanced research to improve rigour and responsiveness of transformational work. It provides scientific analysis to improve the depth and diversity of NATO’s situational awareness and understanding, risk assessment, strategy, and decision making over the mid- to long-term horizon. The Branch coordinates with internal and external stakeholders including NATO Headquarters, Allied Command Operations, the public and private sectors, international and non-governmental organisations, civil society, and academia to ensure that latest concepts, technologies, and processes are applied to relevant work. The Branch is responsible for all outputs pertaining to the Command’s Strategic Alternatives Programme of Work.

Work Tasks

Technical expertise in Branch regarding the application of data science and analytics to strategic alternatives. Leverages various statistical techniques to identify patterns within large data sets to make predictions and enterprise-oriented suggestions. Utilizes predictive modeling to increase and optimize the effects of Warfare Development.Strategies to identify patterns within large data sets, make predictions based on data science, and provide corresponding recommendations to senior leadership. Simplifies and communicates key findings and insights to senior leadership and draws implications for work organization-wide.Predictions based on data science. This line of effort consists of working alongside key stakeholders across NATO to develop and execute data-science strategies over the long-term. This includes both strategies for data science, e.g., how to scale the use of data science in support of every level of decision-making) and strategies informed by data science, e.g., the use of data science to support the development and translation of policy between NATO HQ and the NATO Command Structure.Metrics that improve NATO’s ability to assess effects in the mid- to long-term horizon. Doing so includes the development of comprehensive analytical and mapping capabilities to identify or predict relevant, feasible, and potential challenges and opportunities to NATO and partners.Performs other job related duties as requested.Professional Experience and Education Requirements

Data Modeler, SeniorThe Challenge:

Are you excited at the prospect of unlocking the secrets held by a data set? Are you fascinated by the possibilities presented by the IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence advances? In an increasingly connected world, massive amounts of structured and unstructured data open up new opportunities. As a data scientist, you can turn these complex data sets into useful information to solve global challenges. Across private and public sectors — from fraud detection, to cancer research, to national intelligence — you know the answers are in the data.

We have an opportunity for you to use your leadership and analytical skills to improve a department of defense client.

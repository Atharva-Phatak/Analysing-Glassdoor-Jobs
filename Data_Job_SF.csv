Senior Software Engineer - Revenue Data Platform (Revenue Platform),Twitter,CA,San Francisco,161055,180140,"
Who We Are:

Revenue data has the largest data challenges in all of Twitter. We are making the Terabytes of data we collect every day along with its history fully queryable and searchable in seconds. Advertisers, data scientists and engineers need that data to be broken down by market segments and user attributes that cover as many as 50 dimensions. To make that data easier to generate, store and query we’re building a next generation analytics framework that will power all Revenue data and eventually do the same for Twitter broadly. We seek to make answering questions at Twitter as easy as asking them. Our team is pioneering new technologies at Twitter and was the first to run production services in Google Cloud. By using cloud technologies to solve problems we've learned that we can offload pager and infrastructure maintenance to Google and focus all of our time on solving the large problems that Twitter faces. Given the enormity of the task we face, we need your help to design and implement the tools and services that will make it easy for Twitter to make data driven decisions.

If you have a philosophy of building the tools that solve a broad set of problems, this is the team for you. If you have a relentless customer focus that will help us to accelerate developer and analytic productivity, this is the team for you.

What You'll Do:Rather than speak in generalities, here is a sampling of what we’ve been building:

Large Data Collider (LDC) - Analytics query server with a pluggable backend that gives customers a consistent query interface. By providing consistency at query time, we can swap out backends like Bigtable and Druid to meet the latency or data model requirements of customers.Big Executor - BigQuery and DataFlow Job executor that lets users define their data flows using SQL, opening up data pipeline creation to non-engineers.SuperConductor - General Purpose data loading system that loads well defined data into pluggable backends for querying by LDC. Supports streaming and batch inserts as well as streaming data compression. Automatic Alerting - Will allow users to select the metrics that are important to them and uses models to highlight data outliers so users will be notified of any unexpected product behavior early.

Current/Upcoming projects:Twitter has broadly recognized the platform as where Twitter as a whole wants to go for data analytics. To that end, we need you to help us expand the platform to serve an ever broader set of use cases.

Data Aggregator - Beam based, configuration driven aggregator that let’s users define their Aggregations and dimensions that can run against batch and streaming data sets. Allows users to define their aggregations without redeployment.LDC Views - Build the ability to define custom views on the queries. Will allow users to define business logic and ensure consistent views on data regardless of backend.

What Else You Can Expect:We believe that people are our strongest asset, and take special interest in each and every one of our engineers. You can expect a real investment in your professional growth, and a dedication to crafting a strong, sustainable career for you. Our teams are composed of highly talented and passionate 'A' players, and you’ll get the mentorship and coaching you deserve to hone your skills and expertise. Our vibrant culture and high expectations will kindle your passion and bring out the best in you!

In particular, we are an experienced team of senior engineers that work across batch, streaming, and serving systems to deliver solutions to a diverse set of problems here at Twitter. We move quickly and we expect to make an impact. If this describes your approach to writing software, apply to join us!

Who You Are:

What Brightidea Offers

Market competitive salary and significant equity in a well-funded, growing company
A chance to impact human creativity
Generous vacation and holidays
Top-notch benefits (healthcare, vision, dental, maternity, paternity, retirement)
A unique opportunity to use your leadership skills, experience, and contacts to build a team and shape the culture of the company.

Background

Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.

But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.

At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.

Our Company & Culture

We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.

Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.

Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.

Next is well-positioned to become the leader in the $140 billion small business insurance market because we offer a 100% online experience that is tailored to unique business needs and we get customers insured in minutes - something no one else does. Despite the size of the market, the experience of buying small business insurance has not caught up with best practices instituted in other industries like banking, lending, and even personal lines insurance. There is still a lot of paper involved, purchasing a policy can take days or even weeks, and the coverage is so complex that it’s hard for entrepreneurs to understand what they are buying. We're here to change that. Our goal is to make insurance simple, affordable, and transparent for small businesses so they can stop worrying about insurance and focus on running their businesses.

About the Role

We are a fast-growing tech start-up that is reinventing an industry steeped in tradition. As we design the best SMB insurance experience from the ground up, we face unique analytical challenges: how do you design a “turbo-tax” product experience that helps an entrepreneur cut through the jargon and complexity to quickly identify and buy the insurance they need? How do we design proxy-metrics for what our losses will look like in 3 years on insurance policies we’re writing today?

The ideal candidate is hungry to own company objectives and drive their team towards success through data-driven decisions. They have the intuition to identify important analytical questions, the technical ability for complex deep-dives, and the communication skills to drive ideas into action.

Responsibilities:Work with cross-functional partners to determine the mission of their team, and design the right metrics and targets to communicate this mission

Deep-dive analyses to understand customer, operations, or funnel behavior

Identifying and opportunity-sizing roadmap opportunities to drive prioritization

Translate complex findings into a compelling and actionable narrative

Being the connecting link to data engineering to design the right data model, logging, and data-pipeline foundations

Developing dashboards to track metric progress, understand metric drivers, and answer common business questions

Guiding the team on experiment design and interpretationDesired Skills and Experience:Professional industry experience in a quantitative analysis role

Experience influencing the strategy of a product through analyses

Comfortable in SQL and some experience with a programming language like Python a plus

Experience building clear and easy to understand dashboards, with Tableau a plus

Ability to communicate clearly and effectively to cross-functional partners of varying technical levels

Ability to define relevant metrics that can guide and influence stakeholders to the appropriate and accurate insights

Experience designing experiments, with knowledge of statistics a plus

Associate Scientist - Analytics,Impossible Foods,CA,Redwood City,63302,126497,"Impossible Foods is addressing the most catastrophic threats facing humanity: climate change and biodiversity collapse. A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric C02 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.

The easiest -- if not only -- way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won't give up meat. So we need to make meat better -- more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.

Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products -- and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.

To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.

Our world-class R & D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolutionfrom discovery to commercial production. The only thing that will separate Impossible Foods from success and failure is our ability to recruit more world-class experts.

"Software Engineer, Data Science CoLab",University of California San Francisco,CA,San Francisco,39750,86992,"Job Summary

Note that this position may be based remotely (within US)

The Data Science CoLab is seeking a software engineer to help build UCSF's Data

Library. This position will entail working as part of a cross-functional

engineering team to develop a platform that stores and analyzes cutting-edge

biological data from UCSF researchers with the goal of using your skills and

the large datasets at UCSF to treat common as well as rare diseases. We are

looking for a motivated engineer who is inspired by this mission of finding

novel treatments across a variety of diseases and wants to participate

actively, as well as enable biologists and clinicians to discover trends and

meaning in their data.

As an example of the opportunity, biologists at UCSF have agreed to enter into

a very unique radical collaboration environment that is liberating

single-cell data characterizing patient tumors and their immune systems from

many different cancer types, as well clinical outcomes including treatment

success and survival. We are now also expanding to include novel technologies,

microbiome profiling, and new disease contexts. This includes autoimmunity as

well as chronic diseases associated with aging. We want to leverage this data

to identify novel disease treatments, including immunotherapy and personalized

medicine. In this position, you will help build tools to house this data and to

enable multi-modal data analysis for the UCSF research community.

In this position, you will create architecture to accommodate diverse

biological data types from technologies that have not been housed on the same

platform. The team will also focus on challenges in visualization of complex

data, the integration of multi-modal data, and building an interface that is

accessible for biologists. You will be working with top UCSF researchers,

learning novel biology as it s discovered, and making an impact on the

direction and discovery in the immunology and cancer fields. You will have

freedom to innovate in this space with the tools and infrastructure you will

build that can change the way we do systems biology.

This position is within the Data Science CoLab. The Data Science CoLab is a

collaboration-based research lab that focuses on data analysis and

computational methods development. We are passionate about data science

training for biologists who want to better engage with their data. In addition,

we build tools for biologists to store and interact with their data. Our

philosophy is that successful data-heavy projects happen by integrating

biological understanding and intuition with advanced skills in data science.

This can happen by facilitating close collaborations between experimental and

computational biologists, as well as by empowering biologists to work with

their own data.

As a member of the Data Library team you will apply software skills to projects

of broad scope and educate yourself and team members about software best

practices. You will also interact with scientific datasets and develop detailed

knowledge of their content and usage, and consult regularly with associated

researchers on their subject matter expertise. You will acquire new knowledge

and skills as required by the expanding technological scope of the project.

Background
About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is thrown away, causing nearly a trillion dollars of economic losses, trillions of gallons of wasted water, and billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions. In the US, about 40% of all food waste occurs at the retail level and downstream, largely driven by insufficient technology and manual processes.
Afresh seeks to tackle some of these big problems around food waste. Born out of Stanford's Computer Science PhD program, Afresh is the first Fresh food supply chain company. We bring the cutting edge of artificial intelligence to Fresh food to minimize food waste.
Our machine learning-powered supply chain solutions are tailored for the nuances of perishables. Our first product is a store-level replenishment tool that optimizes the ordering of items in Fresh categories -- produce, meat, deli, dairy, bakery, and prepared foods. The goal is to minimize waste and maximize in-stock rate, and consequently, profit. 
So far, the results are awesome! Like we said above, in live deployments, we have demonstrated the potential to double profits and reduce food waste by 50%+.
We're growing fast: we're in partnership with 4 large regional grocers representing 500+ stores and >$10B in revenue. Our backers include Innovation Endeavors (former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s firm) and Baseline Ventures (first money in Stitchfix, SoFi, Heroku, Instagram).

A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric C02 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.

The easiest -- if not only -- way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won't give up meat. So we need to make meat better -- more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.

Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products -- and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.

To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.

Our world-class R & D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolutionfrom discovery to commercial production. The only thing that will separate Impossible Foods from success and failure is our ability to recruit more world-class experts.

We're looking for an engineer that enjoys working remotely, contributing to open source, and playing around with machine learning.

You will be part of our Machine Learning team, with a focus on improving, debugging, refactoring, and testing our ML library, but also the flexibility to take on other responsibilities when required. We are a startup, so we like people that can wear more than one hat :)

You should be:

Eager to understand things and experiment
Good at working with minimal supervision in a remote environment
Open to discussing, defending and deconstructing ideas
Good at communicating in English, don't worry, you don't need to be a native speak or a poet.
An overall good programmer, especially with Python 3

Ideally, you would also have some:

Understanding of machine learning and artificial neural networks
Basic understanding of probability theory, Bayesian statistics, and linear algebra
Experience working with Pytorch (or tensorflow), numpy, pandas, and sklearn


We love code reviews and on readable yet efficient code. We put emphasis on reviewing our code and independently finding potential bugs, improvements, or refactoring opportunities.

Testing is an essential part of our workflow and is probably not very similar to the kind of testing most people are used to. Since this is ultimately a data-driven product that works on a wide variety of data and for a wide variety of use cases. There's a lot of creativity involved in designing the tests for what you are implementing.

Most important of all, is that you actually like Mindsdb and believe in what we are trying to accomplish. We want to democratize machine learning and we want to make it explainable, most ML solutions out there focus on just making predictions, we also focus on the question:



What is interesting in my data and why?
When should I not trust this model and why?
How can I improve this model?
Why did the model give this prediction?

you will envision, design, build, and support services and tools for data scientists where ""self service"" is the goal.
you enjoy building systems using a mix of Python and Go in an AWS-heavy environment.
you will learn our scientific working environment holistically in order to design better tools.
you take pride in communicating, documenting, supporting, and otherwise understanding scientists when needs arise and the world changes.

Senior Research Associate/Associate Scientist - Analytical Development,Parvus Therapeutics,CA,South San Francisco,-1,-1,"No relocation candidates, only local candidates will be considered

Parvus Therapeutics is pioneering a novel class of disease-specific, non-immunosuppressive biologics called Navacims™ that are designed to halt and potentially cure autoimmune disease and other inflammatory disorders by restoring immune tolerance.

The Navacim technology platform is generating a rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates to address a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Our most advanced programs target Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) (partnered with Novartis) and autoimmune liver diseases. POC and efficacy in animals has been established for these two programs and for multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Drug candidates have also been identified for celiac disease, with others in earlier stages of research. Parvus recently announced that it had entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech covering three of these programs: autoimmune liver, IBD, and celiac. In support of our new partnership, Parvus is expanding rapidly to on-board the additional resources necessary to advance these programs to the clinic.

Navacims are comprised of iron oxide nanoparticles coated with disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHCs) proteins. Navacims trigger significant reduction in disease-associated inflammation without effecting general immunity through the induction and abundant systemic expansion of disease-specific type 1 regulatory T (TR1) cells, resulting in profound and durable therapeutic efficacy as assessed in preclinical disease models.

Our commercial strategy for Navacims follows a mix of corporate partnering and equity financing to support Parvus sponsored internal R&D. We have completed the buildout and start-up of new office and laboratory facilities in South San Francisco. The Parvus management team combines decades of experience in start-ups and biopharma, with demonstrated success in commercializing drugs from concept to market. We are seeking extraordinary and ambitious individuals who share our drive and desire to transform medicine.

Senior Research Associate/Associate Scientist - Conjugation Process Development,Parvus Therapeutics,CA,South San Francisco,-1,-1,"No relocation candidates, only local candidates will be considered

Parvus Therapeutics is pioneering a novel class of disease-specific, non-immunosuppressive biologics called Navacims™ that are designed to halt and potentially cure autoimmune disease and other inflammatory disorders by restoring immune tolerance.

The Navacim technology platform is generating a rich pipeline of therapeutic candidates to address a wide range of inflammatory diseases. Our most advanced programs target Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune liver diseases. POC and efficacy in animals has been established for these two programs as well as multiple sclerosis (MS) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Drug candidates have also been identified for celiac disease, with others in earlier stages of research. Parvus recently announced that it had entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Genentech covering three of these programs: autoimmune liver, IBD, and celiac. In support of our new partnership, Parvus is expanding rapidly to on-board the additional resources necessary to advance these programs to the clinic.

Navacims are comprised of iron oxide nanoparticles coated with disease-relevant peptide-major histocompatibility complex (pMHCs) proteins. Navacims trigger significant reduction in disease-associated inflammation without effecting general immunity through the induction and abundant systemic expansion of disease-specific type 1 regulatory T (TR1) cells, resulting in profound and durable therapeutic efficacy as assessed in preclinical disease models.

Our commercial strategy for Navacims follows a mix of corporate partnering and equity financing to support Parvus sponsored internal R&D. We have completed the buildout and start-up of new office and laboratory facilities in South San Francisco. The Parvus management team combines decades of experience in start-ups and biopharma, with demonstrated success in commercializing drugs from concept to market.

A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric C02 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.

The easiest -- if not only -- way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won't give up meat. So we need to make meat better -- more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.

To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.

Our world-class R & D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolutionfrom discovery to commercial production.

Associate Scientist- Packaging,Impossible Foods,CA,Redwood City,63302,126497,"Impossible Foods is addressing the most catastrophic threats facing humanity: climate change and biodiversity collapse. A global transition to a plant-based food system will turn back the clock on atmospheric C02 levels, restore natural ecosystems and reverse meltdown in wildlife biomass.

The easiest -- if not only -- way to make our civilization sustainable is to eliminate livestock, the most dangerous technology on Earth. But humans won't give up meat. So we need to make meat better -- more delicious and more nutritious, without animals as the underlying production technology. That means that making meat sustainably is the most important and urgent problem for the global scientific community.

Impossible Foods' mission is to completely replace the use of animals as a food-production technology by offering consumers everything they currently value about animal products -- and making products that are vastly superior to their animal analogues.

To do this, we are taking a revolutionary scientific and market-based approach. We are inventing efficient, sustainable ways to transform ingredients from plants into meat, fish and dairy foods that deliver all the pleasures and nutritional benefits consumers demand, without the destructive environmental or public health impact.

Our world-class R&D team has been building the know-how and technology platform to produce meat, fish and dairy foods from plants. Impossible Foods is experiencing rapid growth and is resolutely committed to leading all aspects of the plant-based food revolution-from discovery to commercial production.

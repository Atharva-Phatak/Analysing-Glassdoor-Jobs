Care.com, an IAC (NASDAQ: IAC) company, was founded in 2006 on the understanding that quality family care is both a fundamental human need and a key driver of economic growth and empowerment.

Associate Data Scientist,Levelset,TX,Austin,54209,77372,"Each month over 500,000 contractors and suppliers connect on Levelset's cloud-based platform to make payment processes stress-free. Users easily exchange payment documents like lien waivers, pay applications, and preliminary notices, they see a complete picture of who is on their job, and are empowered with the resources and knowledge they need to be confident in payment. The results are faster payments and fewer surprises.

All of this activity generates millions of entities, records, attribution, and entity relationships. We use this data to create insights about the payment activity of projects and contractors, which helps our users get paid. That's where you come in.

You'll be Levelset's first Data Scientist and have the opportunity to influence how we expand our data science use cases across the business and products. You will need to be a ""data utility player"" and be prepared to be able to move data around, analyze opportunities, select the tools and build the infrastructure to support data science, and use our data to innovate our product and advance our purpose. The work you do and models you build will have a direct impact on our users.

Types of projects you'll be working on:

Text Analysis and Entity Recognition

We send thousands of documents and ingest thousands more from external sources. This data is messy, sometimes unstructured, and we need to be smarter about how we correlate company entities. How can we tell if two companies with similar names are the same or different?
We are collecting thousands of reviews from our users to capture feedback on different contractors on things like payment timeliness, communication practices, etc How can we summarize the overall sentiment of reviews for a specific contractor and what are the common pros / cons?
Advanced Analytics and Data Discovery

We have a lot of data on the payment history of contractors. How can we rate the payment risk of a contractor and share that information with users in a helpful, digestible way?A large commercial construction project can last many years and include hundreds of contractors. Or a single address can have multiple projects over the years with different contractors. Or a property, like an office building, can have different distinct projects going on at one time. How can we tell the difference?Data Modeling and Heuristics A user is on a project that we know other subcontractors are experiencing slow payment on. What other documents should we recommend the user do to ensure they get paid?Most of the construction industry is based on working relationships and prior work history. What relationships and other parties can we infer that are working on the project based on the existing connections from other projects we see in our graph?

Skills you'll need:

1-3 years of experience working with Machine Learning, Optimization, Neural Networks and/or Artificial IntelligenceA broad understanding of data science techniques and a willingness to ""go deep"" and learn more about a specific topic as it relates to our opportunities.Data cleansing experience using various utilities and programming techniquesText analytics, natural language processing, and entity recognition/extraction to turn documents into informationData processing / ETL to prep and clean data for analysis and production pipelines.R / Python / SQL / Cypher.You'll be helping us build our DS stack out, but familiarity with the tools we have in place will help, including: MySQL, Redshift/Postgres, Neo4j, Kafka, RabbitMQ, and the AWS stack.

Data & Analytics Consultant (DAL),SEI,TX,Dallas,46572,71444,"WHO WE LOOK FOR

An SEI Consultant is a master communicator and active listener who understands how to navigate an audience. Self-aware, almost to a fault, SEI consultants keenly understand how to adjust their approach based on the situation. Following a logical, fact-based approach, our consultants possess the superior ability to see correlations others may not, ask the right questions and drive solutions.

As super-connectors, our consultants connect not only people, but data, trends and experiences.

As every project is different, an SEI Consultant must be adaptable and comfortable with unexpected situations. An SEI Consultant must be at ease with ambiguity because although a client knows that a problem exists – they need SEI to figure it out and drive a solution. SEI Consultants define ambition differently. SEI Consultants are authentic, low-maintenance individuals who like to hang out with colleagues outside of work. Whether it be cooking, traveling, hiking, or volunteering, SEI Consultants enjoy working with genuine, thoughtful folks who want to steer clear of the traditional grind and share the joy of day-to-day life and activities with colleagues, friends and family.
